# NeMo Switchyard integration for Hermes

[NeMo Switchyard](https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/Switchyard) is an LLM
router/proxy: Hermes points its OpenAI-compatible `base_url` at it, and
Switchyard routes each request to a model tier. This integration makes that
routing visible inside Hermes:

- a live **footer** (three styles) with request/token/cost totals and the
  last served model, with the model name in NVIDIA green while routed
- the **/router hub** — control panel, config builder (`init`), local
  router lifecycle (`start`/`stop`), provider registration (`connect`), route
  listing/switching (`routes`/`use`), footer toggles, usage, health checks
- **/model integration** — with the provider connected, routes appear in the
  native /model picker and `/model <route>` switches in place
- **/nvusage** and **/nvfooter** remain as aliases
- a **switchyard section appended to the native /usage** (under `nvhermes`)

## When to use

- The user asks to set up / install the Switchyard integration for Hermes.
- **Immediately after installing this skill or plugin for a user** — offer to
  finish the setup right away rather than waiting to be asked. The whole
  thing is one command (phase 3 below) or, for the user themselves, one
  Enter on the `/router` panel's Quick setup row.
- The user asks how to see Switchyard usage, cost, or routing decisions.

## Setup procedure (for the agent)

You do the whole setup; the user answers a few questions. All steps are
idempotent — re-running them is safe. `HERMES_HOME` defaults to `~/.hermes`;
respect it if set. `<plugin-dir>` below means the installed plugin directory
(glob `$HERMES_HOME/plugins/*/nvhermes_main.py` or check
`hermes plugins list`). Never ask the user to paste an API key into chat —
keys stay in environment variables.

**Phase 1 — install (no questions needed):**

1. Install and enable the plugin:

   ```
   hermes plugins install PicoNVIDIA/meld --enable
   ```

   Fallback without git access: copy this skill's source repository into
   `$HERMES_HOME/plugins/nemo-switchyard/`, then run
   `hermes plugins enable nemo-switchyard` (Hermes's own enable command —
   do not hand-edit configuration files).

2. That's it — the plugin grafts the footer into the stock `hermes` command
   when it loads. (An optional isolated wrapper exists: copy
   `<plugin-dir>/nvhermes.launcher` to `~/.local/bin/nvhermes` + `chmod +x`.
   Only offer it if the user asks for a separate command.)

**Phase 2 — interview the user.** Ask these (offer the defaults so "just
use defaults" is a valid answer):

- Do you already have a Switchyard router running? If yes, ask for its URL
  and skip to phase 4.
- Which model should be the **strong** tier and which the **weak** tier?
  Defaults: strong `aws/anthropic/bedrock-claude-opus-4-8` (format
  `anthropic`), weak `nvidia/nvidia/nemotron-3-ultra` (format `openai`).
- Which inference endpoint and which **environment variable** holds its API
  key? Defaults: `https://inference-api.nvidia.com/v1` and `NVIDIA_API_KEY`.
  You never need to see or handle the key: `sw_config.py start` checks
  availability itself and prints exactly what is missing if it cannot find
  the variable. If it reports the variable unavailable, relay that message
  to the user verbatim, pause until they confirm they have made it available
  in whatever way they normally manage credentials, then retry. Never ask
  for the key value in chat, never read it, never write key material to any
  file.
- Which port for the local router? Default `4100`. Verify it is free:
  `lsof -nP -iTCP:<port> -sTCP:LISTEN` must return nothing.
- Where is the `switchyard` executable? Auto-detect first
  (`command -v switchyard`, `$SWITCHYARD_BIN`); only ask if not found.
- Register the router as a Hermes provider so routes show in `/model`?
  Default yes. Explain: this adds one marker-bounded entry to their Hermes
  provider list, removable with
  `python3 <plugin-dir>/sw_config.py disconnect`.

**Phase 3 — one-shot setup** (config → key preflight → router → provider,
idempotent; streams PASS/FAIL progress and exits non-zero on failure):

```
python3 <plugin-dir>/sw_config.py init strong=<model> weak=<model> \
    base_url=<endpoint> key_env=<VAR> port=<port>   # only if the user customized anything
python3 <plugin-dir>/sw_config.py setup
```

With defaults, `setup` alone is enough — it writes the default config when
none exists, and installs the NeMo Relay telemetry library so it is ready
(telemetry stays OFF; the user opts in with `/telemetry on` — never enable
it on their behalf). If it reports a missing/rejected key or missing switchyard
binary, relay its message verbatim and pause for the user.

**Phase 4 — verify:**

```
SWITCHYARD_URL=http://127.0.0.1:<port> <plugin-dir>/scripts/doctor.sh  # every required line PASS
```

**Phase 5 — hand off.** Tell the user, briefly: what was installed and
started; route a session with `hermes --provider router -m router`,
or pick `router` in `/model` once — Hermes persists the choice, so
plain `hermes` stays routed (and `/model` switches back anytime); the
footer and green model name appear exactly while the selected `/model` is a
switchyard route — pin a catalog model or switch providers and the TUI goes
back to completely stock; `/router` is the control panel;
`/router footer` cycles footer styles; `/router usage` or `/usage`
show routing stats.

## Using it

**The interactive path:** `/router` opens an arrow-key panel (↑/↓ move,
Enter acts, ←/→ cycle footer style, Esc closes) with toggles for the router,
provider entry, footer, tier pickers and key preflight. Model pickers filter
as you type (Backspace edits the search).

**The easy path — all inside a session:**

```
/router build         # interactive: pick strong/weak tiers from your connected
                          # models via the native picker (endpoints/keys/formats
                          # are derived from your Hermes provider config)
/router init          # or non-interactive defaults: weak=nemotron ultra,
                          # strong=opus 4.8, nano classifier
/router start         # runs a local router with it (key env vars must be available)
/router connect       # registers provider "router" so /model lists it
```

Then relaunch routed: `hermes --provider router -m router` (or pick
`switchyard` once in `/model` — Hermes persists it) — one model named
**switchyard**; the router picks the tier per request. To pin a specific
upstream model, select it from the catalog in `/model` (every upstream
model is exposed as a passthrough route). `/router disconnect`
removes the provider entry again (it is marker-bounded — nothing else in the
user's configuration is touched, and both commands only run when the user
invokes them). `init` accepts `key=value` overrides: `strong=`, `weak=`,
`classifier=`, `base_url=`, `key_env=`, `port=`, `profile=`,
`strong_format=`, `weak_format=`, `min_confidence=`. If `start` cannot find
the switchyard executable, set it once with `/router bin <path>` or
export `SWITCHYARD_BIN`.

**Per-session env alternative** (no provider entry; the dummy key is fine —
the router holds the real keys):

```
OPENROUTER_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:<port>/v1 OPENROUTER_API_KEY=dummy \
  hermes --provider openrouter -m <route-id>
```

Note: setting only the env base_url without `--provider openrouter` is not
enough — Hermes keeps its configured provider and traffic bypasses the
router. While the session's endpoint fingerprints as Switchyard, the model
name in the status bar renders NVIDIA green and the footer is live.

**Footer styles** (`/nvfooter <mode>`, persisted across sessions;
`SWITCHYARD_FOOTER` env overrides):

```

```

**Commands.** `/router` — control panel (router, managed process,
footer, routes, session totals); `/router usage` (alias `/nvusage`) —
aggregate + per-model usage table and recent routing decisions;
`/router status` — PASS/FAIL health checklist; `/router reset` —
reset the router's stats; `/router footer` — cycle footer styles
(alias `/nvfooter`). `/usage` — the native Hermes usage report gains a
switchyard section under `nvhermes`.

**Raw endpoints** (for scripts): `GET /health` → `{"status":"ok"}`;
`GET /v1/models` → route ids, entries have `"owned_by": "switchyard"`;
`GET /v1/routing/stats` → totals + per-model
`{tier, calls, *_tokens, estimated_cost_usd}`;
`GET /v1/routing/decisions` → per-request
`{tier, source, confidence, outcome, served_model, latency_ms, usage}`.

## Caveats & troubleshooting

- Stats are **in-memory and process-local** to the router — they reset when
  it restarts; persist them yourself if you need history.
- **Streaming responses carry no token usage** at the router; counters and
  cost undercount streamed traffic.
- `/v1/routing/decisions` exists only under a **deterministic routing
  profile** on routers that include per-decision telemetry; everything else
  degrades gracefully without it.
- **No green model name?** The session's endpoint must itself be the router
  (`/router status` shows the fingerprint check) — use the
  `OPENROUTER_BASE_URL` + `--provider openrouter` launch shown above.
  `SWITCHYARD_URL` enables inspection only, not routing.
- **Footer missing?** The session must actually route through Switchyard
  (`/router status`), the plugin must be enabled, and
  `/router footer` should not say `off`.
- **Port conflicts:** pick a free port for test routers; check with
  `lsof -nP -iTCP:<port> -sTCP:LISTEN`.
